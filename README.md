### Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation

Having data on 2,000 musical hits, I wanted to see what makes a song become a hit. To do this I tried to answer the following questions.
1. Do you have to be famous to make it in the music market?
2. What musical genres most often become hits?
3. Do any quantitative characteristics help sketch out the typical characteristics of a hit song?
4. is the machine learning algorithm able to predict whether a song will be a hit?

### File descritions

The project contains two files. One is a data file and the other is a notebook in which the necessary analyses are carried out.
The most important findings can be found here.
